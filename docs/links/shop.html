            <p>Does the regular fit of a beanie just not do it for
                you? this one is slightly larger even though one size
                fits all, and it hangs just a bit lower than your average
                even though you can still fold up the brim and really make
                it your own. This beanie is for those who need a bit more 
                head coverage!
